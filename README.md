# Paketo Tiny Builder

This builder uses a Tiny base image (bionic build image, distroless run image)
with buildpacks for Java Native Image and Go.

To see which versions of build and run images, buildpacks, and the lifecycle
that are contained within a given builder version, see the
[Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/tiny-builder/releases)
on this repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.

For more information about this builder and how to use it, visit the [Paketo
builder documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/builders/).  To learn about the
stack included in this builder, visit the [Paketo stack
documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/stacks/).
