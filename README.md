# Paketo Tiny Builder

## `paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny`

This builder uses the [Paketo Tiny Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/tiny-stack-release)
(bionic build image, distroless-like run image) with buildpacks for Java Native Image and Go.

To see which versions of build and run images, buildpacks, and the lifecycle
that are contained within a given builder version, see the
[Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/tiny-builder/releases)
on this repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.

For more information about this builder and how to use it, visit the [Paketo
builder documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/builders/).  To learn about the
stack included in this builder, visit the [Paketo stack
documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/stacks/) and the [Paketo Tiny Stack repo](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/tiny-stack-release).
