# Stand-alone Procfile buildpack in the Tiny builder

## Proposal

The Procfile buildpack should be added as a stand-alone group to the Tiny
builder's group orderings.

## Motivation

Adding the Procfile buildpack as a stand-alone order at the end of the group
ordering list would provide users that want to run pre-built binaries on the
smallest base image available a supported path to do so.
